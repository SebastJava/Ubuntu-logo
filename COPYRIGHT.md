This [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SebastJava/Ubuntu-logo) is a personal and unofficial creation. It contains a reproduction of the logo belonging to:

- https://canonical.com/
- https://ubuntu.com/

This logo differs from the official version only in a very subtle way. The goal is to propose a logo made of standardized angles and round numbers. A logo drawn with more precision, according to the author SebastJava.
